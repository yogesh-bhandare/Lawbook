# Lawbook: Redefining Legal Practice for Students

Check out my backend work at [Lawbook Backend API](https://github.com/yogesh-bhandare/lawbook-backend-api) – built by a passionate backend engineer!

### Overview

Lawbook is a cross-platform mobile app designed to revolutionize how law students practice and prepare for trials. By providing a virtual moot court, AI-driven tools, and an extensive case library, Lawbook enables students to refine their legal skills, gain confidence in courtroom proceedings, and excel in their academic and professional pursuits.

### Motivation

Preparing for trials and judgments is often limited to theoretical knowledge or traditional moot court setups. Lawbook bridges this gap by offering a realistic, interactive platform for law students to practice, collaborate, and learn in a virtual environment. The app fosters critical thinking and analytical skills, helping students navigate the complexities of legal practice with ease.
